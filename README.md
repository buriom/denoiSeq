# denoiSeq
R package for Differential Expression Analysis.
Given count data from two conditions, denoiSeq determines which transcripts are differentially expressed 
across two conditions using Bayesian Inference of the parameters of a bottom up model for PCR amplification developed in 
the paper: Chromatin conformation governs T cell receptor JÎ² gene segment usage publication by Ndifon et al.
