R package for Differential Expression Analysis.
Given count data from two expermental conditions, denoiSeq helps one determine which transcripts are differentially expressed 
across two conditions using a bottom-up model for PCR amplification developed in 
the publication; Chromatin conformation governs T cell receptor J beta gene segment usage publication, by Ndifon et al.
