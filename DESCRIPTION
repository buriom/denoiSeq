Description: Given count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts are differentially expressed across the two conditions using Bayesian inference of the parameters of  a bottom up model for PCR amplification. This model is  developed in the paper titled, "Chromatin conformation governs T cell receptor JÎ² gene segment usage," by Wilfred et al, and culminates into the superpostion of the binomial and negative binomial as the modelled distribution for the counts.
