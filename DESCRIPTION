Description: Given count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts are differentially expressed across the two conditions using Bayesian inference of the parameters of  a bottom-up model for PCR amplification. This model is  developed in "Chromatin conformation governs T cell receptor J beta gene segment usage" by Wilfred et al, and culminates in a distribution for the counts that is a superpostion of the binomial and negative binomial distribution.
