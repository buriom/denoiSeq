Description: Given count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts are differentially expressed across the two conditions using Bayesian inference of the parameters of  a bottom up model for PCR amplification derived in http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15865.full. This model is a superpostion of the binomial and negative binomial distributions.
